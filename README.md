# Js Frameworks CA
This is a school project where we used react to create a display of Video Games  

##Notes To Teacher
I read feedback from MA4 and i tried to apply it in this task.
Im tried making it mobile first, im using a grid system for the layout
and i noticed most of the styles were universal. But for the layout i used media queries where mobile were defined first.
Media queries starts at lines: 46, 202 and 274 in the App.css file

I used a beautify to make the markup more readable, and commented where i felt it was necessary
Please give me feedback if the code was readable or if theres still anything i need to approve upon

I have a repeating-linear-grid as background, had some problems with it not working on some browsers.
Im not quite certain that it is the right design choice, but if it does not load for you thats ok.
Just wanted you to know that it is supposed to be there.
